## Intentionally empty.
##
## qubes.UpdatesProxy is a socket service on most other templates, but under
## Whonix it is a normal executable service. Neither of the configuration
## options usually present in this file (`skip-service-descriptor=true` and
## `exit-on-service-eof=true`) are applicable to executable services.
##
## This file still exists to make it easy for Whonix to set configuration
## options for this service should it become necessary in the future.
